web workers
Web Workers are a simple means for web content to run scripts in background 
threads. The worker thread can perform tasks without interfering with the user 
interface.

service workers
Service Worker API
Service workers essentially act as proxy servers that sit between web applications, 
the browser, and the network (when available). 
They are intended, among other things, to enable the creation of effective offline 
experiences, intercept network requests and take appropriate action based on 
whether the network is available, and update assets residing on the server. 
They will also allow access to push notifications and background sync APIs.
It takes the form of a JavaScript file that can control the web-page/site that 
it is associated with, intercepting and modifying navigation and resource 
requests, and caching resources in a very granular fashion to give you complete 
control over how your app behaves in certain situations 
(the most obvious one being when the network is not available).
